If you do not meet metrics you are put on a plan for 30 days and if you don't meet them you get fired. They have a team that listens to your calls and then pass or fail you. Your metrics also depend on surveys left by customers who use the survey to complain about eBays policies which in turn brings your scorecard down which leads to coachings and write ups if metrics are not met. Angry customers leave bad surveys period especially, when you will not remove feedback for them, will not close a case in their favor or there are technical issues. Customers use the survey to vent not aware they are affecting the reps livelihood. The policies are constantly changing as well and this makes sellers very upset. The embg policy needs to be changed as buyers abuse it often leading to sellers getting scammed out of their item and money. The feedback system also needs to go as it is outdated and sellers call angry that it cannot be removed. The shift bid every few months causes a poor work/life balance as well and you will have a difficult time getting the schedule you want if your metrics are low. Coaches micromanage as well as the team leads. Agents in other Countries will hang up on you when you try to transfer or pretend they cannot hear you. Premium Service Agents are constantly being given more and more responsibilities without a pay increase. The constant audits on agents calls is too much and leads to a negative experience as your are constantly being told what you need to work on vs uplifting the agent. Focus on the positive as well. Agents will also say they will call a member back and then do not leading to an angry customer and leaving you with the bad survey. Agents also promise things to members to get them off the phone then the next rep pays for it. Dealing with angry customers takes someone with a strong backbone for sure. There is a lot to learn and often you do not get the support you need.",

Set up an anonymous way for employees to give feedback. Customer service reps are on the front line and they know what the members are upset about. Filing complaints for the customers was futile and the micromanaging of auditing how the agent classifies them is tedious and makes their job more stressful. Make changes to the customer survey so there is an option for the members to vent about ebay without it affecting agents metrics. Not all calls can be resolved especially when an agent is following policy and this makes the members mad. Reevaluate the eMbg policies and give agents the ability to look at the entire case to decide the outcome. Too many buyers select the item is not as described option to avoid paying return shipping when the reason for the return is clearly remorse. Also sellers need more protections when it comes to buyers sending back their old item as the return or using an item then returning it as not as described and the seller is out the money and the item plus the return shipping costs. Set up a separate feedback system for customers to vent other than on the survey and get rid of feedback for sellers and buyers to leave eachother as it leads to angry sellers and them constantly calling trying to get it removed.",

If you do not meet metrics you are put on a plan for 30 days and if you don't meet them you get fired. They have a team that listens to your calls and then pass or fail you. Your metrics also depend on surveys left by customers who use the survey to complain about eBays policies which in turn brings your scorecard down which leads to coachings and write ups if metrics are not met. Angry customers leave bad surveys period especially, when you will not remove feedback for them, will not close a case in their favor or there are technical issues. Customers use the survey to vent not aware they are affecting the reps livelihood. The policies are constantly changing as well and this makes sellers very upset. The embg policy needs to be changed as buyers abuse it often leading to sellers getting scammed out of their item and money. The feedback system also needs to go as it is outdated and sellers call angry that it cannot be removed. The shift bid every few months causes a poor work/life balance as well and you will have a difficult time getting the schedule you want if your metrics are low. Coaches micromanage as well as the team leads. Agents in other Countries will hang up on you when you try to transfer or pretend they cannot hear you. Premium Service Agents are constantly being given more and more responsibilities without a pay increase. The constant audits on agents calls is too much and leads to a negative experience as your are constantly being told what you need to work on vs uplifting the agent. Focus on the positive as well. Agents will also say they will call a member back and then do not leading to an angry customer and leaving you with the bad survey. Agents also promise things to members to get them off the phone then the next rep pays for it. Dealing with angry customers takes someone with a strong backbone for sure. There is a lot to learn and often you do not get the support you need.",

Set up an anonymous way for employees to give feedback. Customer service reps are on the front line and they know what the members are upset about. Filing complaints for the customers was futile and the micromanaging of auditing how the agent classifies them is tedious and makes their job more stressful. Make changes to the customer survey so there is an option for the members to vent about ebay without it affecting agents metrics. Not all calls can be resolved especially when an agent is following policy and this makes the members mad. Reevaluate the eMbg policies and give agents the ability to look at the entire case to decide the outcome. Too many buyers select the item is not as described option to avoid paying return shipping when the reason for the return is clearly remorse. Also sellers need more protections when it comes to buyers sending back their old item as the return or using an item then returning it as not as described and the seller is out the money and the item plus the return shipping costs. Set up a separate feedback system for customers to vent other than on the survey and get rid of feedback for sellers and buyers to leave eachother as it leads to angry sellers and them constantly calling trying to get it removed.",
